1/if in line 1 of the code above is miss, what happens after that and why?

The led will keep the initial value and the timer interupt can not excecute the function timer_run() because timer0_counter = 0.

2/if in line 1 of the code above is changed to setTimer0(1), what happens after that and why?

The led will keep the initial value, with the duration = 1 and TIMER_CYCLE = 10 make timer0_counter = 0 so the timer interupt can not excecute the function timer_run().

3/if in line 1 of the code above is changed to setTimer0(10), what is changed compared to 2 first questions and why?

if duration = 10 and TIMER_CYCLE = 10 => timer0_counter = 1 => the timer interupt will occur every 10ms, the timer now can interupt  because timer0_counter > 0 so that the function timer_run() can be excecuted.
